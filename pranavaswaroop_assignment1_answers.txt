1. ROS nodes : Launch ROS core and carry out the following tasks
(a) List the currently running nodes

    ans: when using rosnode list; observed /rosout as the currently running node when running roscore

(b) What is the purpose of node /rosout

    ans: as per ros wiki ROS, The /rosout node is part of roscore. rosout subscribes to the standard /rosout topic, records these messages in a textual log file, and rebroadcasts the messages on /rosout_agg.
    client libraries are required to publish console logging messages to the /rosout topic as a standard interface. 

(c) List the currently running topics

    ans: when running rostopic list: observed /rosout,/rosout_agg as the currently running topics

(d) What topics are subscribed by the node /rosout

    ans: when running rosnode info /rosout; observed Subscriptions as /rosout [unknown type]

(e) What topics are published by the node /rosout

    ans: when running rosnode info /rosout; observed Publications as /rosout_agg [rosgraph_msgs/log]

(f) What are the services provided by the node /rosout

    ans: when running rosnode info /rosout; observed services as /rosout/get_loggers and /rosout/set_logger_level

(g) Kill the node /rosout and again list the running nodes. What is your observation.

    ans: when killing the /rosout node with rosnode kill /rosout command and then listing the nodes with rosnode list , 
    observed that /rosout is still running after being killed. the roscore terminal shows that the node was killed but then restarted, this is observed as pid is differnt.

(h) What are the functions of commands cleanup, info, kill, list, machine &
ping of the rosnode command-line tool

    ans: when running the rosnode --help command; observed that 
        1.rosnode ping tests the connectivity to node
        2.rosnode list lists the active nodes
        3.rosnode info prints the information about the specific node
        4.rosnode machine lists nodes running on a particukar machine or list the machines
        5.rosnode kill kills a running node
        6.rosnode cleanup purges the registration info of unreachable nodes

2.
(b) Launch rqt_graph. Save its screenshot as question2_rqt1.png Comment on your
observations from rqt_graph.

    ans: on running the command rqt_graph; observed that the node /pranavaswaroop_pubnode is publishing to /rosout topic

(c) List the running nodes in the terminal. Save terminal screenshot as question2_terminal2.png

    ans: on running rosnode list; observed /pranavaswaroop_pubnode and /rosout nodes are active

(d) Modify the publisher code to run concurrently three publisher nodes with the name
'<your first name_node1'. Run rqt_graph and save the screenshot as question2_rqt2.png
. Comment on your observations from rqt_graph.

    ans: running the publisher python file 3 times after adding the anonymous=True in node initialization and running rqt_graph; 
    observed that three nodes with names having the given name(pranavaswaroop_node1) as a starting and differnt end (some numbers) is running. all three are publishing to /rosout

 3.
 (b) Run rqt_graph and save the screenshot as question3_rqt1.png. Comment on your
observations from rqt_graph.

    ans: on running both publisher and subscriber python files, and running the rqt_graph command; 
    observed that node /pranavaswaroop_pubnode is publishing to both /rosout and /Greetings topics. 
    subscriber is subscribing from /Greetings topic and publishing to /rosout.

4.
(a) List the currently running nodes

    ans: when running rosnode list command; observed /CET, /M1RAA_24_26, /pranavaswaroop and /rosout nodes as active nodes.

(b) List the currently running topics

    ans: when running rostopic list command; observed /hello_class, /hello_college, /welcome, /rosout and /rosout_agg topics.

(c) What is the role of the node rosout

    ans: when running rosnode info /rosout command; 
    observed that the node /rosout publishes rosgraph_msgs/Log to the topic /rosout_agg and subscribes to rosgraph_msgs/Log from topic /rosout.
    It also shows that /rosout node is connected to all three nodes.
    from this it can be understood that /rosout serves some functions in enabling other nodes to log information and also serves as the master node.
    /rosout node serves as the master node as all the created nodes are connected to /rosout.
    the log info can be used for debugging.

(d) Change the name of node 2 to 'M1RAA 2024' and rerun the code. Write down any
error message displayed.

    ans: when running the code after changing the name; observed 

    M1RAA_24_26.py:8: UserWarning: 'M1RAA 2024' is not a legal ROS base name. This may cause problems with other ROS tools.
    rospy.init_node('M1RAA 2024')
    [FATAL] [1729704058.356889]: unable to register service [/M1RAA 2024/get_loggers] with master: ERROR: parameter [service] contains illegal chars
    [FATAL] [1729704058.362149]: unable to register service [/M1RAA 2024/set_logger_level] with master: ERROR: parameter [service] contains illegal chars
    [INFO] [1729704058.374333]: publishing test

    after getting the error when running the rqt_graph command under list all active nodes and topics, 
    the graph shows the 'M1RAA 2024' node is disconnected from even /rosout node. the graph is saved as 'question4_rqt1.png'
